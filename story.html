        <h2>What if technology didn’t scare people, what if it helped people?</h2>
        <h2>The world would be a better place.</h2>

        <h1>My First Business</h1>
        <p>As I grew up, I noticed a theme. People were scared of the very tools that empowered them. We rarely love what we don’t understand. In middle school, I made a business out of training people how to use a computer and building websites and networks to help them succeed in their small businesses and personal work.</p>
        
        <h1>High School</h1>
        <p>In high school, I began to write code and hone my design skills I always took design very seriously because I knew no matter how sophisticated the tool, if it was unusable, it was worthless.</p>
        <p>When the iPhone was announced in 2007, I was inspired to design and prototype my own portable device, which designed UI and a system architecture for.</p>

        <h1>College and Beyond</h1>
        <p>I chose to pursue a degree in Computer Science because I believe in the power of software to improve the lives of people around the planet. I believe that computing should “just work” and that technology should integrate seamlessly with ones daily life. While working in IT in college, I observed first hand the challenges people have with computer and I am inspired to be apart of building elegant, user friendly solutions.</p>
        <p>We can’t settle with the way things are. To push humanity forward we must build better tools that delight and inspire. Things can be better, and I can build them.</p>
